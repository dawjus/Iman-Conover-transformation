# Iman-Conover-transformation

Engineering thesis in medical physics at AGH.


The aim of this project was to create a model that reproduces the photon statistics to create a therapeutic beam based on the existing phase space in the IAEA format, allowing simulation of the dose distribution on phantoms. Monte Carlo simulations and Iman-Conover transformations were performed to obtain the results
